# wordle-cli
Python-based command-line tools for analyzing Wordle and offering guesses.

"wordle-analyzer.py" runs a letter counter. Edit the source file to select a file (lists of possible or used words).

"wordle-guesser.py" offers semi-random guesses with some intelligence based on the wordle-analyzer output. You can choose your own start word, or have the tool select it automatically. Upon completion of a puzzle, the tool stores the latest word into the used words text file.
